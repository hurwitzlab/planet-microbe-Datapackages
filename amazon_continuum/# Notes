# Notes 

## NCBI dataset:

### 2010 :

#### minor corrections :
- removed the attributes "sequencing_machine", "sequencing_method", "investigation type" and "target_molecules"
- correction of "lat-lon" attribute into separate "lat" and "lon" attributes


####Â issues remaining for this DP:
- Time and date to collapse as a standard format -> is it GMT or local time?



data from the R2R cruise https://www.rvdata.us/search/cruise/KN197-08


### 2011 :

#### minor corrections :
- removed the attributes "sequencing_machine", "sequencing_method", "investigation type" and "target_molecules"

### 2012 :
Issue with some samples with a date in 2016 but noted as part of the 2012 sampling expedition...
Issue with samples not from the same Atlantis expedition -> where did they come from?
