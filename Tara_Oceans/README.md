### Pangea sample metadata
Collects metadata about samples associated to the Tara Oceans expedition in Pangea : 
https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.875582

- carbonate chemistry : https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875567
- nutrients : https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875575
- pigments HPLC : https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875569
	
#### Minor corrections
In Nutrient dataset :
- AHX, ARD_2, ARG: removed ">0.8" and ">3" for "Size fraction, upper threshold"
- APX : "Size fraction, lower threshold" attribute was removed
- units were not provided in the https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875575. We derived the units from the parent dataset https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.836319
- the attributes "Depth, top/min" and "Depth, bottom/max" were removed from the datapackage because describing the sampling event, not the samples

In HPLC dataset :
- AHX, ARD_2, ARG: removed ">0.8" and ">3" for "Size fraction, upper threshold"
- APX : "Size fraction, lower threshold" attribute was removed
- units were not provided in the https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875569. We derived the units from the parent dataset https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.836319
- the attributes "Depth, top/min" and "Depth, bottom/max" were removed from the datapackage because describing the sampling event, not the samples

In carbonate dataset :
- AHX, ARD_2, ARG: removed ">" for "Size fraction, upper threshold"
- APX : "Size fraction, lower threshold" attribute was removed
- ARI : removed pH, Carbon dioxide, Carbon dioxide, partial pressure, Fugacity of carbon dioxide in seawater attributes (empty for this dataset)
- units were not provided in the https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875567. We derived the units from the parent dataset https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.836319
- the attributes "Depth, top/min" and "Depth, bottom/max" were removed from the datapackage because describing the sampling event, not the samples

## Sampling_event
Collects metadata about the sampling events during which samples were obtained. Original data was retrieved from the Pangea event registry : https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.842227

The original Pangea dataset was parsed and attributes selected for relevant information using a custom R script available in scripts/mapTara_NCBI_PANGEA.R

### Minor corrections : 
- Event type attributes were derived from the Tara event label
- ARD_2, ARG : the events types named "control" were renamed to "filtrations" to be more informative.

## Niskin profiles
Collects metadata about the column of water during sampling events. Original data was retrieved from the Pangea Niskin profile dataset :
https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.836319

200 Niskin profiles were downloaded from Pangea (see Niskin_profiles.txt for complete doi list). Each profile was cleaned using the command :

	sed -n -E -e '/\*\//,$ p' $FILE | sed '1 d' > $FILE.tsv

The cleaned profiles were imported and merged as one unique table, and the relevant Nisking profiles were retrieved and included in each datapackages. Script used to import, merge and select the relevant profiles is available in scripts/mapTara_NCBI_PANGEA.R

## sampling_event water context
Water column context for the sampling events were obtained from Pangea : https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.875579

In PANGEA the water column context is linked to the sample registry. Information about the sample was removed from the dataset, dereplicated and matched to the sampling_events registry. When different records matching the same sampling_event ID, the records containing the most metadata was kept.

## sampling_event Ardyna water context
Water column context for the sampling events were obtained from Pangea : https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.875577

In PANGEA the water column context is linked to the sample registry. Information about the sample was removed from the dataset, dereplicated and matched to the sampling_events registry.

## Campaigns
Campaigns informatations were retrieved from the Pangea registry of all campaigns : https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.842191

Relevant information were selected and renamed using the script available in scripts/mapTara_NCBI_PANGEA.R
