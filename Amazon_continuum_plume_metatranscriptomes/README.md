# Amazon continuum datapackage

## sample_NCBI
Collects metadata associated to the amazon continuum metagenome in NCBI : 
- non-specific metatranscriptomes: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA237345  
The "Plume" dataset contains the KN197-08 expedition (may-june 2010) and the AT21-04.

#### Minor corrections were done in order to help the use of the metadata :
  - collection_date normalized to a unique format (dd-mm-yyyy)  
  - PAR measurements from the metagenomes were transformed from Em-2/sec into Î¼Em-2/sec to be consistent with the metatranscriptomes.
  - for the AT21-04 samples, the density was converted from g/ml into kg/m-3
  - for some AT21-04 samples, the date was incorrectly set to 2016, and was corrected to 2012
  - missing units from the metagenomes were derived from the metatranscriptomes
  - The biome "surface seacater" was corrected into "large river delta biome"
  - The feature "large river Plume" was corrected into "river"
  - Biome, feature and material purls were added from ENVO
  - the attributes "investigation type", "sequencing machine", "sequencing method", "target molecule" were removed because describing the experiments, not the samples.
  - lat-long field was split into a lat and long attributes
  - date field and time fields were reformated into standard format (dd-mm-yyyy and hh:mm)
  - an ISO-DateTime field was created from date and time

## sampling event
This table was generated using the samples information. Briefly, unique sampling event where derived from the station number and the ISO-DateTime.

For the KN197-08 and AT21-04 expedition, the Sampling event ID were generated as follow: "expeditionName_station_dateTime"
The sampling event type "pump" was inferred from the collection description in Satinsky et al. 2014: https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-2618-2-17

For the second expedition, the Sampling event ID were generated as follow: "expeditionName_station_date_sampledVolume"
The sampling event type "pump" was inferred from personnal discussion with the corresponding authors of Satinsky et al. 2015: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-015-0099-0

## campaign
This table was inferred from information from the Rolling Deck repository.
