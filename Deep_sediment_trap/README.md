# Deep sediment trap datapackage

## sample_NCBI
Collects metadata associated to the Deep sediment trap project : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/482655
Only 'omics samples were taken into account. MAGs and pooled samples were removed from the datapackage.

#### Minor corrections were done in order to help the use of the metadata :
  - "Lat/long" field was separated in a "lat" and a "long" parameter
  - units in the "depth" attribute was removed and added as unit purl
  - "collection date" field was removed. A "start collection date" and a "end collection date" was obtained from personal conversation with the authors.
