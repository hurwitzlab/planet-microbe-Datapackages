A volume of 20 Litres was treated with FeCl3, incubated at room temperature for 1-24 hours to allow viruses to precipitate, filtered onto a 1-micrometre-pore-size, 142-mm-diameter GE polycarbonate (PC) membrane filter (ref:K10CP14220) placed on top of a 0.8-micrometre-pore-size, 142-mm-diameter Pall Gelman support filter (ref:60114) using a peristaltic pump with pressure <15 psi. The 1-micrometre-pore-size filter was then packaged in a sterile Falcon tube (50 mL) (up to 3 filters in 1 tube), labelled with a barcode identification sticker and stored on board in a refrigerator at +4 degree Celsius. Note 1: Latex or nitril gloves were used for this protocol. Note 2: All containers, filter holders and tubing were washed with 0.1% bleach, rinsed twice with fresh water and rinsed again twice with the pre-filtered sample material. All tweezers are kept clean with ethanol. Note 3: The three replicates were incubated together. For 20 Litres of filtrate, 2 millilitres of FeCl3 stock solution (4.83 grams of FeCl3-6H2O + 100 millilitres of MilliQ water, stored at 4°C) was added (final concentration of 1 mg Fe per Litre of filtrate), and shaken vigorously for 1 minute. Note 4: Further details about the method are published here doi:10.1111/j.1758-2229.2010.00208.x. In 2009-2012, a total of 3 replicates were prepared and sent for later analysis to the University of Arizona (UA), Tucson, USA. In 2013, a total of 2 replicates were prepared, one sent to for later analysis to the University of Arizona (UA), Tucson, USA, and the other sent for later analysis to the Observatoire Océanologique de Banyuls sur Mer (OOB), France."
